### Hi! I'm Tommy McMichen,
I am a PhD candidate at Northwestern University, advised by [Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/Team.html#Current), with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and Computer Science from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I study compilers, specifically looking into new abstractions and representations, rethinking existing compiler paradigms to improve how we handle data movement in traditional and emerging domains.
